# iracepy-tiny

(Somewhat) minimal Python bindings
for [irace: Iterated Racing for Automatic Algorithm Configuration](https://github.com/MLopez-Ibanez/irace).

This package is a fork/reimplementation of [`iracepy`](https://github.com/auto-optimization/iracepy) with a reduced
feature set, which tries to be somewhat more pythonic (i.e. define scenarios and parameter spaces dynamically in code,
not in static configuration files).

For more information on `irace`, see its [documentation](https://mlopez-ibanez.github.io/irace/index.html) directly.
